# 🧪 Lab 2 – Perform Hash or HMAC Calculations

## 📖 Scenario
A multinational company has undergone a network attack and hired a forensic investigator.  
The investigator discovered suspicious code fragments that appear familiar and need to be cross‑checked against a malware database.  
Because the code is very large, direct searching is inefficient. Instead, the investigator computes **hash values** of the code to quickly identify traces in the database.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compute hashes of files and text strings.  
- Verify file integrity using hash values.  
- Check hashes on **VirusTotal** to determine if files are malicious.  

> **Note:** Hashes or hash values may also be referred to as *checksums*.

## 🖥️ Lab Environment
- Windows Server 2022 virtual machine  
- Web browser with internet connection  
- Administrator privileges

## 📘 Overview of the Lab
This lab familiarizes you with **HashCalc**, a tool that helps you determine the hash values of various files.  
By generating and comparing hash values, investigators can establish file integrity and detect malware traces efficiently.
